Diabetes Prediction Model
This project uses machine learning to predict diabetes based on patient health data from Kaggle.
It includes data cleaning, feature scaling, and visualization, followed by training three models—Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM. 
Their performance is compared using accuracy, precision, and recall, with helpful charts to illustrate the results.
